I remembered thinking the Zalto Bdx was better than the others, and even the Riedel was better than the gabriel Glas. I thought maybe the GG was too small. The Riedel is cheaper, poorly constructed, and old-fashioned, I would tend to guess it doesn't perform the best. The Zalto is by far the most expensive, and feels ridiculous to handle, so while part of me doesn't want it to perform the best (because it's out of my price range), part of me thinks it might. \n\nPoured ~1.5 oz into all three (might have done slightly more in the GG) . Started nosing ~5 minutes after pouring. This is a wine I know to be a bit high in acetaldehyde at first, but then to open up after ~30 minutes into savory secondary flavors and sweet fruit. \n\n--------------\nNo Swirl\nN1: Top aromas - Gabriel glas is the strongest, whereas the Zalto is weakest. Riedel vinum is in between. - I think it's just how narrow is the glass and how far away is the liquid from you. I'm getting a lot of detergent/glass smell on these glasses - next time wash better. With just water. \n\nN2: Tim Gaisers technique: light open-mouth sniffs\nGabriel-Glas smells the most focused on the wine. The others are a bit glassy/detergent-ish. Maybe they aren't as well cleaned as the Gabriel?\n\nN3: Medium deep.\nRiedel: medium sweet aromas, bit of funk. Moderate intensity. \nGabriel glass: moderate/moderate-plus intensity - higher than Riedel, sweetness, figgy acetaldehyde, sweetness, and funk. \nZalto Bdx: alcohol, bit of sweetness. Moderate intensity. \n\n[side note: Gabriel-Glas seems to be bringing the N1 aromas up in a much more focused way - higher intensity, clearer. ]\n\nN4: Back-end. \nZB and RV were similar. The GG was slightly higher toned, mustier in a good way. All are taking on a Port-like figginess. \n\n--------------\nSwirling\nN1: Top aromas\nGG is the best. Clearer and showing the deep tones better. Also shows brett. \nRV shows a bit of funk, maybe even Brett. slight. Pretty good. \nZB shows just light acetaldehyde. The weakest. \n\nN2: Tim Gaiser light open-mouth sniffs\nThey are all great, but the GG is the most concentrated, extracted, glossy-black. It's nice. It smells the sweetest. The most opaque. The most blackberries and blackcurrant character. \n\nN3: Medium deep.\nThe GG wins hands down - focuses the aromas more. The other two have more light, floral noses, like a Barolo. The stuffing and fruit and warm black liquorice character shows more in the GG. \n\nN4: Back-end. \nZB: poupourri\nRV: barnyard\nGG: lots of stuff: acetaldehyde, barnyard, warm leaves - bamboo leaves in the summer. Dirt. Slightly more delineated. \n\n--------------\nTasting:\nThey are all about the same. \n\nConclusion: \nFor this wine, the Gabriel-Glas was the highest-volume, most dark-fruit toned, clearest, and most enjoyable.	90.3529411764706

There's an implied earthiness that permeates this and the last wine, as if the wine is real, detailed, analog, organic, non-airbrushed, continuous instead of discrete. \nNo evidence of oak. \nThis wine is complex and developing. \n\nPalate:\nDry. Medium body, medium alcohol (12.5-13) that feels hot in the context of this wine. \nThe palate overall seems a bit lost in alcohol, though there are moderate intensity flavors of ripe lemon and wax on the midpalate.

I'm not so much a fan of the way this finishes, or the somewhat hot nature of the midpalate, but it is balanced in a particular way. \nThe balance seems to me analogous to nebbiolo - floral and high-toned in aroma and flavor, but with some alcoholic heat and acidic punch. \n\nConclusion:\nThis has to be the '07 Riesling.

My impression this time, aside from the characteristic Musar tamari, animal notes from Brettanomyces and bruised apple/fig from oxidization, was one of a very large grapey blackberry, looming over secondary details of chamomile, earth, tobacco. I've thought this before with young Musar - I wish the fruit would get out of the way just a little so the secondaries could shine through.\n\nIt seemed awkward, young, the flavors a bit separate and disjointed (compared to how Musar can be at its best). Will it change more? I'm not a fan of the current fruit character. Will it change or go away? Is my palate changing with this wine? Maybe I'm becoming more attuned with secondary aging flavors, and this wine is just behind the curve. \n\nReferring to my notes, I tasted this in 2010 (at 11 years), and thought it was beautiful, emphasizing fruit. I enjoyed the fruit character, calling it "real, true fruit." I noted how it didn't quite have the emotional impact of the '95, which had had a profound impact on me not that long before. \n\nI tasted it again in London at the end of 2012 (at 13 years) and noted a grapey fruit core that I didn't particularly enjoy, though the secondaries and Musar character still made for a great wine. \n\nMost recently, I tasted it 2 months ago (at 16 years) at the tail end of a formidable lineup: the '91, '94, '96, and '98. I noted it was somewhat closed (it hadn't been decanted), and the fruit was "plummy." \n\nExtrapolating, I'd say that for me, the fruit character of the '99 isn't up to par with the '95. Maybe it will get out of the way and turn into a fantastic secondary and tertiary wine. Maybe I'll never like it as much as the '95, my one fantastic bottle of the '94, or that great bottle of the '96 in Orono. Or maybe it will surprise me in young-adulthood. \n\nSensory Notes:\n\nVisual:\nMostly clear, just bright. Dark garnet, moderate to moderate-minus concentration. Some sediment.\n\nNose: \nBrett and Acetaldehyde were high initially, as was a dark grapey blackberry note. Over time the nose became much more refined, more complex, but still chubby and not fully-integrated. Primary aromas of blackberry, dark plummy fruit. Secondaries of tamari, dried cherry, dried tomato, and chamomile tea. Complex, and still developing. \n\nPalate:\nModerate in body. A slight impression of elevated alcohol that works very well in context of the flavors and acidity. The balance is such that it stands on its own, yet also works with food. Midpalate flavors of tamari, blackberry, dried cherry, tobacco, some dusty, woody oak peeking through on the palate (not excessive, presenting as a bit of clove and nutmeg and freshly-sanded wood). [Aged for 1 year in Nevers oak - age of barrels unspecified]. It finished with just moderate to moderate plus in length, with very little impression of tannins and a bit of tart malic sourness, which I associate with acetaldehyde. \n\nOverall: \nThat I wasn't completely taken with how this bottle was showing did not distract from the facts of the evening. We had several other wines to contrast, but only this seemed to rise up and have a conversation. It paired phenomenally with the roasted squab, dusted lightly with Indian spices. \n\nScore: Around 9.	91.4595588235294

Once I went Riesling, I pretty much guessed the country based on RS.\n\nBut overall I did an excellent job going through the grid and remaining open. The faint terpenes made sense - Riesling is technically a terpenic white, though lower in aromatics than, say, Gewurztraminer. The strong acidity was a key indicator.\n\nLM mentioned 2010 was a cool year so probably there was no Botrytis. I still think I smelled it, and it's not unusual for the region/style. So maybe this was a clue. I need to figure out what Botrytics smells like.	91.3333333333333

Gaiser: defined by what it's not)\nPinot Gris / Pinot Blanc (too low in alcohol, no phenolic bitterness)\nAlbarino (Doesn't fit aromatically)\nRiesling (too low in acidity)\nChardonnay (could be chard - not a very distinguished chard. Maybe a village, unoaked Burgundy).\nGruner Veltliner (doesn't fit aromatically. Probably would have higher alcohol and maybe acid). \n[Forgot to do possible countries, but I was sort of thinking of those along with the varietals]\n\nFinal Conclusions\nThis is Pinot Grigio, from Italy - specifically Alto Adige, 2013 vintage.

Coroa Godello\nSpain - Galicia: Valdeorras DO\n$20\n\nAnalysis:\nI was pretty much on the right track.\n\nLM commented that Albarino is close - Godello is often blended with Albarino. The aromatics don't match though. Chardonnay was also good. Godello has more pear/orchard fruit like Chardonnay. Godello is pretty rare - might be on a Masters-level exam, but it's pretty obscure. \n\nGodello could be a lateral for unoaked Chard, pinot grigio, other unoaked, moderate-acidity, non-aromatic whites with no other defining characteristics (like higher alcohol or phenolic bitterness). \n\nNotes from GuildSomm on Godello:\nValdeorras produces straight Godello for white, and Mencia for red.	87.25

Low-intensity fruit tones of slight overripe apple, light savory tamari and forest floor, and dried cherry emerge.

But the color is a bit dark - maybe more syrah? (didn't get black pepper though). Also it's oxidative and bretty, which fits Grenache from Chateauneuf du Pape. \nItaly: Can't see Nebb (acid and tannins aren't high enough). Can't see Sangio or Barbera or Brunello (acid isn't elevated). \nLebanon: Not Musar: Not enough tamari, dark fruit, cherry (also who pours Musar by the glass? I can't believe I even considered this.)\nOxidative. maybe Rioja? (No American Oak).\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThis is an Old World wine from a moderate climate. This is a Grenache-syrah-mourvedre blend from France &gt; Chateauneuf-du-Pape, from an older or hotter vintage (I don't know the vintages in this region. from Bdx maybe 2003/5/9? \n\nActually. 2012 Chinon?!?!\n\n2012 Beatrice et Pascal Lambert\nChinon "Les Terrasses"\n13% alcohol\n$19\n\nTurns out I made a reasonable call for my tasting note, but upon retasting, my judgment was super off. It seemed like the wine transformed in the glass, but maybe it was just lack of calibration. Here's what seemed to happen as I went back after LM told me the wine: \n\n-The nose transformed, expanding into brighter fruit tones, and in one whiff revealing some dark green bellpepper pyrazines (but then not again). \n-The palate transformed. I tasted it again and my mouth dried up with moderate tannins - fine and powdery [remember JoeG's advice to assess tannins only after the second taste, because they take a while to build up. ]\n-Alcohol seemed to calm down, body seemed leaner, juicier, more red-fruit, more lean structure. Medium- body, medium alcohol, medium/medium+ acid. \n\nLM:\nThis has only moderate alcohol. \nTannins are more than low - they are moderate. Both oak and grape tannins. Fine grained tannins suggests from oak (I need to read up on this. I think it's a bit more complex). \nDoesn't get oxidization. \nNotes: dark green pyrazines, plum skins, tobacco. \n[based on these I went Right Bank bdx, because I didn't get the pyrazines, said more merlot than Cab Franc]. \n\nOther theories: I'm recovering from a cold. I didn't smell any pyrazines on the other Loire CF I tasted. Maybe I lose my pyrazine ability with a stuffed nose. \n\nNo sulfites - this wine is probably just falling apart or falling to bottle variation. It's definitely oxidized. \n\nSummary:\nInitial impressions were all alcohol, acetaldehyde, and Brett. I blinded this as a Ch. du Pape but eventually it seemed to get leaner, tobacco-y, bright dried cherry, slight green tone (very faint for me). Very surprised by the earthiness on this Chinon. Acetaldehyde blew off after a while and it was really lovely. That said, I wonder if it would be better if they'd used sulfites. 2012 and already falling apart! \n\nIt wasn't unenjoyable, but I probably wouldn't order it. \n\nScore: between 8 and 8.5.	83

It was served very cold (some RS perhaps? - I warmed it a bit before tasting). \nIn the glass it is clear, day-bright, pale straw with reflections of green. \nNo gas or sediment. Viscosity is moderate minus. \n\n[tasted before nose to check for RS - there was.]\nOff-dry. I got a hint of the moscato-like fruity detergent but I think that may just have been a "whoa! wake up, palate" aroma. I didn't get it after. \n\nNose: \nThe nose is clean/sound, and youthful. Very light greenness - maybe a light-green dull herbaceousness (pyrazine???) sits on top of low-intensity fruit aromas: underripe melon/melon rind, green apple, pear, grapefruit bitterness. Underneath I got notes of musty furniture, bitter aromas with faint mushroomy earthy reduction. No evidence of oak aging (or large, neutral barrels). \n\nPalate:\nThis wine is off-dry (moderate RS) [I need to calibrate - I have no idea where this lies on the sweetness scale.]. Medium body, moderate- alcohol, high acid! Primarily tart green-apple-malic acidity. \nOn the palate return flavors of green apple skin, lemon, lemon rind, slight herbaceousness (pyrazines?! I'm not sure!). The finish goes on and on - a three-part perfect harmony of ripe Meyer lemon, tart round green-apple skin acid, and light but insistent sweetness. They last for nearly a minute then diminuendo as one. \n\nInitial conclusions:\nI'm puzzled. The lemon, the RS and the high acid suggest German or Austrian Riesling (RS rules out Alsace, alcohol isn't high enough for Savennieres, I'm not getting any aromatic descriptors of Chenin from Vouvray). Then again, do I decide to call the "green tone" pyrazines? [here's where I went wrong. If they are pyrazines, they are super-faint. How likely is it that there's an off-dry Sauvignon blanc with moderate minus alcohol, ripping acidity, (i.e. a beautiful structure) and diminished-to-no pyrazines? It doesn't exist. ] Anyhow I just said I was confused, but I thought German Riesling or Sauv Blanc from some weird region. I should have assumed typicity (it is Nopa, after all) and dismissed my "sweet sauv blanc" notion.\n\nLM's notes:\n1) It's just off-dry. Not moderate sweet or sweet. \n2) It's not pyrazine. It's more of a slight mintiness, dried herbs, herbaciousness. \n3) The reduction I'm smelling - she called it beach ball or shower curtain - is "petrol". \nThe structure and aromatics should get you to Germany or Austria. \nSlight mintiness and more green apple fruit should get you to Mosel. Other regions in Germany are more yellow fruit / stone fruit.\n4) There's minerality here: Minerality can be lots of things - chalkiness, more of a sensation - tartness, slate/stoniness, or even maybe an iron bloody clay type thing. \n\nBollig-Lehnert\n2013 Flagfish Riesling - Mosel\n9% Alcohol (Did I notice any alcohol?

Some light bricking. I expected more, given the 750 I opened in '08 had noticeable bricking as well. I wonder if the color aging is slowed because this is in magnum?\n\nThe nose took a bit of time to open up (we should have decanted). Initial nose of dried sour cherries, freshly cut bell-pepper, dried leaves, forest floor, and some pure cherry tones at the core. After some time more stewed bell peppers emerged, along with fleeting, shifting glimpses of black raspberry and wild blueberries, more earth tones and a light savory/umami undertone. The nose is different than I remember, softer, leaner, softer. \nIn the mouth, this is light-bodied, with medium+ acidity (tart, malic), medium tannins (still grippy - a bit grainy) and low alcohol. Low intensity, low extraction, but beautifully balanced with strong acidity and earth and cherries on the finish. It's speaking softly, but saying interesting things. It's also a bit of a memory, though different than I recall. I remember it as deeper, more intense. Given the fruit, acidity, and tannins, this may go many years more - the fruit isn't fully tertiary yet, and maybe more savory and earthy notes will emerge. \n\nI have a hard time grading this objectively. It's not extracted and polished like the 95 Pavie Macquin, but it has more on the palate than the Pavie, and it's a lovely reminder of one of my first significant tasting experiences (I tasted this same vintage back in 2008). \n\nIf wine could talk, this would say: "Hey, remember me? I'm still here. Slow down and listen. I've got a few new things to say." Light, yet complex. Not overwhelmingly delicious, but beautiful and interesting.

Despite all these descriptors, the nose wasn't over-sweet. None of us could resist returning to this over and over again to smell. EH likened the nose to a story of baking a lemon pound cake. First you smell the vanilla, the citrus, the butter, the cream. Then you smell it while baking - warm, expansive notes. Then as it matures in the glass you get more dried sweet aromas.

It lingered on the finish, the secondary non-fruit aromas fading leaving a rich tone of lemon curd along with vibrant acidity. This wine is nervoux, exciting, delicious, well-articulated, and un-complicated. One can deconstruct the reasons why it works so well, or just smell it and sigh.

In the mouth it is medium-bodied, medium+ sweetness, medium alcohol, and strong, clean acid. It all balanced out perfectly. Extending a point about Sauternes and acid and aging that LM made, it really seems like the heart of this wine is acidity, and point of the sugar is to support that beautiful, crystalline acidity. 40 years old and shows no signs of slowing down or tiring - it seems like this wine could go on forever. I think my notes say (and I could be misreading) - "drinking burnished gold in a field in sunshine" - whatever that means. \n\nScore: Between 9 and 9.5	91.6153846153846

On the nose, my initial impression was of acetaldehyde, lean sharp green pyrazine (St. Julien, vineyards are 72% cab, 20% merlot, 8% cab franc), undertone of brett, and a glimmer of savory, distant fruit. Over time it opened up, but seemed fleeting. I needed to listen carefully and use some imagination to reconstruct it, but it had so many interesting things to say. I wish I were alone with it in a quiet well-lit room, free of other distractions.\n\nOn the palate my first impression was one of austerity and leanness. At first (and especially after the young Vermentino blend), I thought "This is like slightly bretty, oxidative, tart, tannic water". But then I seemed to get past the initial front and found it polished, refined, and expressive - intriguing and beguiling, even. I was struck by the many tertiary aromas that presented themselves, slippery and enmeshed. I definitely felt a lack of context to really understand this, but it was easy to be drawn in. TS Eliot's quip about great art being easy to recognize, difficult to understand comes to mind. \n\nNo score, as I have no previous context. I've been curious about older Bdx for a long time - it was awesome to be able to taste this.	88

On the nose, it has slight but definite acetaldehyde (OX). However as the wine opened up, this was accompanied by a serious bouquet of deep, syrupy fruit, blueberry, raspberry, earthy tones reminiscent of Musar (though more restrained, not bretty or overtly funky). There's a meaty, tamari sweetness to the aroma that got more and more beautiful and hard to pinpoint over time. In the mouth it was significantly heavier than the Chambolle-Musigny. M+ body, M+ alcohol, M tannins. M acid. Really nice and stately on the palate with, again, a bit of savory earthiness reminiscent of huitlacoche and.... Musar!

The taste profile does not do this wine justice: medium body, medium acidity, low+ tannins, medium alcohol (13.5%). The acidity carried from the midpalate through an exceptional finish, imbuing the wine with a characteristic vibrancy. Approximately 1 hr after decanting, the savory fruit core kicked up a notch, causing an apparent deepening and strengthening in the glass. This wine is quite developed, and it's hard to imagine it getting any better. It's hard to imagine any wine getting any better.\n\nIt played nicely with sauteed oysters, and shined when paired with pasta and oyster mushrooms in browned butter.

Significant bitterness on the finish, which should help me narrow down the varietals.\n\nOld world, definitely.\n\nVarietals:\nPinot gris/pinot grigio (because of lightness and bitterness).\nPicpoul - because of malic acid and bitterness and lightness.\nGewurz - no, the aromatics and body aren't there.\nMarsanne-roussanne blend (rhone white). Not fat/oily enough. too much acid.\nVerdejo - no, I don't find verdejo bitter. \n\nI'm going with Kirk's guess of a dry pinot gris from Oregon.\nI'm not a fan of this wine. \n\n09 Montagny 1er cru, Blason de Bourgogne. 13%. ??????\nNever had a chard this bitter. Maybe it was something to do with the fermentation/crushing? Or maybe the grapes weren't ripe, which would explain the distinct lack of fruit. Usually I get this level of bitterness only in specific varietals - pinot gris, verdicchio, gewurz, picpoul.\n----\nThis explains a lot:\nFrom a fellow taster on CellarTracker:\n\n"According to the Wine Doctor, Kris Kissac (website) "Montagny premier cru is one of those most aberrant of misnomers, like Bordeaux Supérieur, nomenclature that clangs with grandeur but in fact relates to little more than alcoholic strength." The only qualification for the premier cru classification in this region is that the alcohol be more than 11.5%.""	85

Oxidized.\n\nNote: I notice from my notes this is the second time I've tasted this wine, and both times I thought it was oxidized. The others are probably right that this isn't a unique bottle flaw, however I'm pretty sure its oxidized to some extent. Whether you consider it a fault in the wine is subjective. Were it in Musar I probably wouldn't mind. However here it seems out of place, and certainly not pleasant. For my palate, this wine (probably all bottles) is slightly faulted. \n\nBack in '08 I tasted three other argiano wines at the Vias trade tasting, and one of them, the '04 solengo, smelled a bit oxidized. At the time I chalked it up to lingering effects of an oxidized wine I'd smelled earlier (it tends to stick in my palate), but now it seems like a slight coincidence that all three wines are from '04. Not statistically significant for sure, but enough to make me suspicious of Argiano's vinification style.\n\nNote: Roy Richards' minority tasting note from World of Fine Wine:\nRoy Richards: Reductive and maybe faulty - revisit it. The dried out palate would tend to confirm this is corked, albeit slightly. Second bottle also in the same bitter vein, so probably TCA.	90.8214285714286

Nose is... delicious musar. acetaldehyde, tamari soy sauce around rich fruit. Just a tad high on the VA gives the nose an overtly "glassy" sheen to me. Smelled oxidized to some - I agree, but unusually for me it didn't inhibit my enjoyment of the flavors. Maybe it's something special about Musar, or maybe I'm so familiar with this wine my brain is filling in typical tastes. Light brett. Beautiful. In the mouth savory tamari fruit with brett. Typical medium-body effortless balance. There aren't many producers that I've tasted as much as Musar. Certainly none have been more fascinating, and more pleasurable. If my tasting notes are a bit sparse on this wine, it's only because my memory and imagination can easily fill in 90% of the experience.	91.4576271186441

Gorgeous.\n\nPaired with the exquisite meaty deliciousness of slightly blackened pan-sauteed royal trumpet mushrooms (sliced thick) with butter, salt, and pepper. And pyrenees brebis - amazingly flavorful. The perfect texture/fattiness to complement the wine without overwhelming it. This is an excellent pairing! + a raw avocado that was a little too fatty and flavorless to pair well.\n\nChris D liked it instantly! Julie D said it seemed vibrantly tart, even before the finish. $30.\n\nI don't disagree with Dexterng entirely. I've had more powerful wines, with more assertive presence (the '02 Dom. des Comtes Lafon Meursault Clos de la Barre comes to mind). Perhaps my exuberance in the score is reflective of my rather recent fascination and newfound appreciation for white burgs - especially with well-integrated oak.\n\nNote: This wine was delicious to drink until the end of the bottle. This + the 94 Musar are the only wines in recent memory that have been this good, for the entire bottle. 13.5%\n\n// note on mushrooms:\n\nPleurotus eryngii is also known as king trumpet mushroom, french horn mushroom, king oyster mushroom	90

Cork was black all the way through and rotten - came out in crumbles, but no sign of seepage. Medium garnet with light bricking in the glass, this wine had a nose of tamari, leather and dry leaves wrapped around a core of blackberry. Not a syrupy blackberry, or blackberry pie, but a varnished painting of a blackberry viewed by candle light. The typical Musar oxidation (slight) and clear brettanomyces presence were also there. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with a slight savory character and an impressionist rehashing of the nose. This is just a beautiful wine.

Superb nose of cassis, leather, Brett (I particularly liked the Brett balance of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol - the former is 'wet dog' or 'horse's ass' and the latter is clove, which was very faint for me). This fruit was RIPE. In the palate it was rich with significant umami coming through in the form of tamari, as well as some integrated Brett that reminded me of a lambic I had at Novare Res (something oude geuze... $13.50... not Hanson's). A tad rich in balance (more acidity would have been nice) and a bit simpler on the palate than I expected given the nose.	88.6

Good flavors but the nose has an off tone.	89

In the mouth it is rich and soft, with medium oak presence and decent acidity on the finish, though it lies a little flat on the midpalate. Low tannins. \n\nThe oak isn't too much - it's well-contained. I think this really is what people are looking for from a $20 malbec, but for me personally... I'm just not that excited by the structure (or lack thereof). Great nose, though.	87.8360655737705

Not very fruit-focused. In the mouth it was definitely medium-bodied with a slight oily texture. Good acidity with significant bitterness that went well with an aged goat cheese, ossau-iraty, and a rather underwhelming piave vecchio. Overall, pretty good except for the bitterness - which I was able to deal with because of the cheese.\n\nThe producer, Sartarelli, makes exclusively Verdicchio.	87.5

Secondary flavors of grape, orange peel, red apple, flowers, and wet forest leaves. In the mouth the flavors swirled and blended. Medium bodied, it carried its sweetness effortlessly, with a touch of grapefruit bitterness and crystalline acidity. New, surprising flavors appeared far into the finish. This wine has it all: sweetness, acidity, flavors, finish, intrigue, surprise, and saliva-inducing aromatic complexity. Amazingly, all of this is packed into a 12.5% medium bodied moelleux! Superb. Serve slightly cool (~65F), but not cold. (~$35).	89

The nose had a light but clear tone of pure vanilla, supported by wisps of ripe pear. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with good balancing acidity and a nice woody bitterness. Not complex or deep or profound, but clean and delicious. Like a Sonatina written for children. Simple but well done. Paired exquisitely with the roasted octopus - the slight bitterness of the charred octopus plus the significant (clean) acid in the dish melded beautifully with the wine. Easily a +1 pairing. \n\nCVTN: "This was featured at the recent Blue Point dinner, and was a solid favorite. Classically made and balanced with a creamy nose, this also has the stuffing to stand up to a variety of foods - good acid" \n\n(picked up on the fr. oak foudres and malo).	83.6666666666667

On the nose this was a little tired, but the mouthfeel was so silky and perfectly balanced, It was phenomenal to drink. In fact the balance and structure was so good that it was hard to concentrate on - everything was integrated, acid, alcohol, fruit all flowed together. It was as if the liquid wine itself disappeared and simply spoke the flavors directly into my brain. (yes, I know I'm being a bit silly).	95.5263157894737

As it was La Paulee that weekend, we met the winemaker, Dominique Lafon, after the dinner.\n\n1/11/2011 - I'm going to add that nearly two years later I still remember the fantastic mouthfeel, perfect integration of oak, and darkly iridescent depth of flavor.

I don't know how to explain the extra dimension but by comparison - I tasted a Veuve-Clicquot yellow label later the same night, and the crassness and lack of integration in the nose was almost offensive in contrast. In the mouth it had a perfectly elegant balance. No single component - sugar, fruit, yeast, acidity, mousse, alcohol - stood out above the rest, and as a result the flavors came through the structure with memorable clarity. It was unremarkable at first sip, then grew in complexity and deliciousness with each course, at once complementing the food and refreshing the palate.\n\nPrice: around $200 per bottle.

Super-sexy oak integration, with more roasted nuts and rich coffee than I detected on the nose. A little low on the fruit - rather indistinct plum, but such nice oak without being woody or sawdusty. Great balance and slightly fleshy texture - this has some weight to it! 85-88.\n\nI may be a bit exuberant in scoring this, but this wine is RIGHT up my alley oak-wise and balance/structure-wise. While the Thackrey blew me away with complexity, THIS has the elegant balance that the slightly sweet Thackrey didn't. This isn't as interesting, but it's got the YUMMY factor!	85.6

Painful actually - it hurts my tongue. Pretty much just oak. Some green flavors - why in Aussie Shiraz? When it's really really really hot, it can interfere with flavor ripening. Stunts photosynthesis? --&gt; pyrazines. \n\nI'm not sure how to score this. On one hand, I don't like it - it's characterless, over-oaked (24 or 34 months in Fr and Amer according to Ringland), has super-fake acidity (it actually felt like the acid was in a different country than the rest of the wine, very separate), and really has no complexity. On the other hand, it's undeniably delicious and has balancing acidity to deal with the porty sweetness. Objectively I'd have to say in the high 80's or even 90's if you like that style. For me personally I'd like to go 60 on this, just cause it rubs me the wrong way.	87.0970873786408

The midpalate has most of the aforementioned flavors, plus some roasted lamb and roasted carrots. \n\nCertain aromatic elements remind me of the '00 Guigal La Mouline, though this doesn't have the La La's elegance or balance. The syrupy flavors and oak influence remind me a little of the '05 Clos L'Eglise (cotes de castillon). But for the most part this is quite a unique experience for me. Moreover, this wine keeps evolving in the glass, as the brett blows off, other flavors rise to prominence in turn. Maybe my score is an overreaction for having tasted a disappointing string of wines lately, but screw it, I'm going 95 points on this baby.	89

In the mouth it was mellow, flavorful, and satiny. Medium body, excellent acidity integrated with savoriness, very soft, barely perceptible tannins. It was neither rustic nor noble, neither humble nor elegant. I found it both interesting and delicious. I won't score it due to the clear oxidative presence, but I enjoyed this wine very much.\n\nIt evoked an image of an aged artisan - someone with a long life, at the top of his craft, but not noble or a peasant.

Parker, Jr.\nWe decanted the La Mou for ~2.5 hrs before drinking. As soon as the wine was in the decanter, everyone started sneaking sniffs - coffee liqueur, polvoron, smoky bacon fat, HUGE tiramisu.\nBy the time it came to drink it, I for one was on the edge of my seat. \n\nAnd when I smelled it, I melted and actually banged my head on the back of my chair. Medium ruby in the glass, the La Mou had a bouquet of liquorice, nuts, cherry, tobacco, bacon fat... the flavors came in washes. I was a bit disappointed that the tiramisu I'd loved so much in the decanter wasn't more prominent in the glass, but still, the wine had a 97-point bouquet. In the mouth it was med/med- bodied, the epitome of elegance, savory, well-integrated oak tones, phenomenal balance, just effortlessly graceful, myriads of flavors that changed with each taste. It doesn't punch you in the face, and the palate is transition-less. Not bold or super-intense, but damn good. Hard to articulate why, but the emotional response was instant and visceral. \n\nIt was every so slightly disappointing. I was hoping for a bit more on the palate, maybe more tiramisu and fruit on the nose, but still, it was one of the best wines I've ever tasted. If we hadn't decanted it and tasted it in the proper place amongst the lineup, I don't know if it would have shown as well.

Good finish, but the tannins stick around even after everything else. Not enough acid to clean your palate. Not really drinkable now - could use 3-5 years. Aging will help it, because it has the fruit and acid, alcohol, extraction, oak treatment - it just needs the tannins to calm down a bit. If you had it with food it would take care of itself.

Turns out it was an Aussie Moscato. Gotta look out for this structure type in the future. Overall, acid not high enough, sugar isn't justified by fruit extraction, nor balanced by acid.

In the mouth the wine has a light sweetness, light peaches and apricots on the midpalate, refreshing med+ acid, med- bitterness on the back end, which disappears quickly to a fruity finish that's fairly short, but clean. The bubbles are not that pleasant - huge and mouth-filling, which is annoying to drink. Overall, a serviceable sparkler, but not one I'd revisit. The big bubbles are sort of pissing me off, actually - I'm going to let it sit for a while to remove them. 80 because it's balanced, but I'm not feeling this wine.	88
776573	472669	Red	2005	Château Barreyre	France, Bordeaux, Bordeaux Supérieur	Château Barreyre	Red Bordeaux Blend	Red Bordeaux Blend	France	Bordeaux	8/14/2008	False	85	Went to the LWS and asked the owner for an example of unique terroir - I said I'd be willing to go up to $25, but the owner said "no, no, you don't need to go that high to get something interesting. Why don't you start with this?" The wine cost $16.50, which I think is totally reasonable for what it is.\n\nBarreyre is from a villae called Macau, which is very close to Margaux AOC (on the south-east corner, pretty much). I've had one wine from there before, the '02 Guittot-felloneau, which I found to be nice, but quite bitter and without fruit. Judging from this wine, which tasted very similar at the beginning, I probably should have decanted the Guittot 30 minutes prior to taking it to the restaurant.\n\nMy friend who is as into boardgames as I am into wine brought two recently aquired games, so we had a great evening learning about two board games and one wine, and seeing how each evolved over several hours.\n\nTasted with neutral bread and water, spitting the whole time.\n\n2005 Chateau Barreyre (Bdx Superieur)\n\nTriple-decanted (bottle--&gt;decanter--&gt;bottle--&gt;decanter).\n\n15 min:\n\nImpressively black with slight purple-garnet rimming, this wine had an earthy nose of bitter-smelling undergrowth and forest soil after a rainy day, and hints of black fruit underneath. In the mouth it had even more earth on the midpalate, med acid and rather weak (though present) tannins accompanied by significant bitterness on the finish. It was quite similar to the Guittot-felloneau in this bitterness, but to give it credit, there was a decently long fruit finish. At about 20 sec, the fruit finally subsides and acid briefly makes itself felt before a rather strong bitterness appears. My guess is that they pressed the wine too hard, or maybe used a salasso to increase flavor concentration and color. Or maybe the grapes were just that good. Anyhow I could forgive the bitterness and heat (14% alcohol) because the earth in the midpalate had something interesting to say.\n\n20-25 min: Sweet cassis on the nose is starting to emerge, the wine appears rounder. As it warms, the alcohol is more irksome. Still bitter.\n\n40 min: Man this wine is friggen BLACK!!! A bit hot, full in midpalate. black fruit balancing the earth, still bitter on the finish.\n\n1 hr 20 min: Still some bitter dirt on the nose.\nexpansive dirt/fruit on midpalate high bitterness.\nHot. Pairs amazingly with burnt bits of the bread.\n\n1 hr 30 min: N (using an impitoyable): Huge black fruit, almost strawberry, oak is shining through. P: reminds me of an aussie cab or shiraz, big bold, alcoholic. This is a different wine, and not as interesting.\n\n3hrs, 30 min: some tertiary aromas of salvadorean tamales\n\n5 hrs: altoid hints?!?!?! really big and fruity Not interesting any more. alcohol comes through a lot.\n\n5:45: oxidized. It's dead.\n\nTo sum up, this wine really had the most to say, in my book, in the first hour or so of life. I really felt like I was smelling a beautiful forest's soil, which I dig. I had issues with the tannin texture, bitterness on the back end, alcohol level, acid (could have been higher), but it was an interesting , real wine, and I feel like I learned something from it. This was the first time I've tasted a wine from opening the bottle to oxidization!	87

After ~20 minutes decanting, the pepper subsides a bit, leaving pure, delicious, real fruit and great acid, med tannin.\n\nPairing: paired well with chicken, but honestly was great by itself. 90.\n\non WLTV wayd:\n\nSomewhere along the brief wine road I've traveled I got the impression that Chianti's are in general underperforming wines. Nevertheless I was compelled to choose this half-bottle by virtue of the fact that... it was the only sub-$20 half-bottle of red wine in the store that I hadn't tried. At $16/half, I'm already not too happy with the price point, but heck, it was just me and some roast chicken for dinner, what would I do with a whole bottle on a weeknight?\n\nIn the glass the wine was medium-garnet, with low brilliance. Then I took a whiff and completely left the room for a moment. I was back in my old room, with one of my best friends and a bottle of '05 Dom. Cheze Saint Joseph (Ro-Ree). Beautiful strawberries, raspberries, and black cherries on the nose, with a bit of oak rounding out the fruit. Quite a dose of black pepper that bothered me a little as it sometimes took over the fruit. A very real nose - as opposed to the fakey-fake Yalumba GSM I had recently (good in it's own way, but oh the Skittle!).\n\nIn the mouth the wine was light and soft (but not watery), with bright med+ acid and pleasant med/med- tannins - a reassuring grip, I thought. The fruit that I liked so much on the nose came through on the palate, albeit less distinctly. Overall the wine was a bit un-focused on the palate (arrrgggh, and I promised myself I'd never use that Gary-ism!), but I really had a personal connection to the nose.\n\nOver all:\n\nPure delicious fruit, great acid, med tannins, bit o' pepper, light and flavorful, pairs well with roast chicken, but I preferred it on it's own.	88

Smelling the nose I immediately regretted every single "chocolate" descriptor I've used in a tasting note, because this smells EXACTLY like an 85% Valrhona bar. I'm smelling one now, and thinking of the wine. Yes the wine had some cherries underneath, but the valrhona was so strong that if I had a glass of the chocolate right next to the wine, I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. Slight hint of cassis in the Valrhona also shows in the wine. In the mouth it is light and relatively simple. Med- body, smooth, with low+ tannins and med- acid.

In the mouth it is med+ bodied, dry, med-tannins (silky), med+ acidity, and a nice finish of ~65% Valrhona. Some blackberries/cassis on the midpalate. Very pretty structure and low bitterness. I wonder that the fruit doesn't seem completely ripe. '05 was an excellent year all over France, I've heard. Perhaps the grapes ripened too fast in this particular area, and the vintners were forced to pick at a reasonable brix, though the fruits hadn't achieved full flavor development. They should have been more careful with de-stemming, pressing, and punching down/pumping over. $18	88

Ripe, clear papaya. Nothing else. My mom looked extremely skeptical and rolled her eyes... then went "wow!" \n\nP: Good midpalate fruit, though the papaya doesn't come out as clear as on the nose. Crisp, razor-sharp, clean, strong acidity, just a little sweet (dry to most people), so overall, a very well-balanced wine. Perhaps a little on the acidic side, which was tamed by food. Medium-bodied, with a hint of oiliness and faint frizzante. Clean finish with minimal bitterness. \n\nI'm retasting it at room temp to make sure... but this might just be the best QPR I've ever encountered for my palate. From what I can tell it's soundly made. 86pts\n\nRetasted at room temp:\n\nCorrection: excellent papaya in the midpalate, slight honeyed quality in the mouth, but still excellent acidity. I'm not sure about the frizzante, it might just be the strong acidity causing the prickly sensation on the tongue. I still taste papaya in my mouth after a minute - not just acidity on the finish! fruit also! I'm going 87. This was good.	87

I cannot see this at all, but then again - this is the first and only sweet sherry I've had. \n\nOpalescent black-brown in the glass, this wine stinks of rubbing alcohol and artificial coffee - reminding me more of a liquor like tequila or rum, than a wine. At 16%, I'm disappointed it can't hold the alcohol as well as some Mollydooker's I've had at that ABV. My nose hurt, even though it was chilled. In the mouth the sherry was extremely cough-syrupy, unctuously sweet, with hints of dates and figs, but I can't call it rich because it was so damn rubbing-alcohol-like. \n\nThis may be great as part of a mixed drink, or cooked in some dessert, but it absolutely cannot stand to be sipped alone (for my palate).	91.6426799007444

My main complaint, however, is a certain quality of fruit on the midpalate that is undrinkable to me.

A good, delicious, simple wine. \n\nGiven the last three sub-$10 wines I tried from WLTV: Panarroz 2006, Altos los hormigas bonarda, and Tour de la roque, I was a little hesitant when pouring this. In fact, I didn't realize how skeptical I was until I smelled it, and sighed in relief. When I tasted it and it was dry, I sighed again.

661034	129474	Red	1996	Joël Taluau Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil Vieilles Vignes	France, Loire Valley, Touraine, Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil	Joël Taluau	Cabernet Franc	Cabernet Franc	France	Loire Valley	3/26/2008	False	95	In brief:\n\nThis is an extraordinary wine. Currently in perfect balance and harmony. Double-decant for an hour before drinking. \n\nIn full:\n\nIn honor of Gary Vaynerchuk's request for WBW 44, I chose a cab franc from a region I have not tried before, at a higher price point than I'm used to, and with more age on it than any wine I've had before.\n\n1996 Jöel Taluau St.-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil AOC, Vieilles Vignes, 12.5%, $35 at the Princeton Corkscrew.\n\nThis is an extraordinary wine.\n\nWhen the longish cork was halfway out, I caught a whiff of vinegar and panicked. Fortunately there was no such smell after the cork was out. An unmistakeable tone of green pyrazine wafted from the neck of the bottle, giving me pause. The green bell-pepper tone was not something I enjoyed in the two Cab Francs I've had before, and I was hoping that this wine would be pyrazine-free.\n\nAnyhow, I went ahead with double-decanting, observing a nice ring of fine sediment around the bottom of the bottle. Some hints of Salvadorean tamales and stewed bell peppers emerged. Even with the greenness, it smelled delicious. Like a delicate stew broth. I was torn: On one hand, I didn't like the green tones. On the other - my mouth was watering!\n\nFirst Tasting, 40 minutes after decanting:\n\nThe color is a lovely peachy-orange-purple, which shows textbook signs of age at the rim and in the body. Very much what I'd expect from Michael Broadbent's color charts.\n\n(Aside: N1-N4 refer to four different ways of smelling ("nosing") the wine. N1 is gentle, extended sniff of the still wine surface. N2 is a deep inhalation above the still surface. N3 is a gentle sniff after a swirl. N4 is a deep inhalation after a swirl. )\n\nN1 evokes mint, cut wood, bell-peppers, and hints of tobacco, all with an undertone of ripe fruit. N2 suggests olives and wood, with some fruit. N3 mostly reveals pyrazine, with some menthol tones. Although there are earthy tones in the nose, there is no "barnyard" - this is a clean wine.\n\nOn the palate this wine is completely captivating. Dry and medium-bodied with beautiful, refreshing acidity and a gripping tannin structure that suggests several more years of life. The midpalate has spicy suggestions of sweet jalapeno candy, which transitions into a somewhat bitter finish, all the while framed with flutterings of unmistakeably ripe fruit. A 91-point wine.\nAs I tasted again, the nose revealed cinnamon and herbal tones, with woody strawberries and raspberries.\n\nSecond Tasting, 80 minutes after decanting:\n\nThe aromas have bloomed into a bouquet of finely stewed bell peppers/jalapenos seamlessly interwoven with black raspberries (N1). Some volatile acidity is present, with hints of BBQ-sauce sweetness, and slight carmelization (N2). So RIPE! Yet with none of the raisiny characteristics that bother me about over-ripened wines. Ripened to such perfection that the pyrazines don't bother me. N3: I'm drooling. Lusciously gentle yet clear fruit blooms voluminously on the midpalate. Unique yet... strangely comforting. Reminds me of the first time I played an ivory-keyed piano - it seemed warmer to the touch, immediately set my fingertips at ease. The feel was so beautiful, and strangely familiar. There are also hints of dusty earth, but so clean! Grass, pomegranates, warm hillsides drenched in sunlight, clear tones of Black raspberry, plum, warm rocks in the sun, I don't want to stop smelling this. N4: A little earth, some charred/tobacco tones.\n\nPalate: SO MUCH FRUIT! Charming cassis acidity, rich green, brown wood tones, hints of malt on the midpalate (but totally dry). The acidity has many shades to it - it's not so much a razor, as a multifaceted gem rolling around on your tongue! In context of the wine's flavor structure, the acidity is the bridge between initially warmer fruit tones (strawberries, black raspberries) and a brief but crytal-clear cassis tone in the midpalate. Suggestions of orange and spice, a little bitterness on the finish, but I LOVE it! It's like bitter cinnamon tea, or bitter green tea - a rich bitterness. Perfectly elegant tannins. True finesse. Hard not to swallow this - like imbibing a deep-blue petaled flower of exquisite beauty and aroma. Mild tertiary scents of roasting chicken skins, basil, cloves. On the latter part of the midpalate - a soft but distinct spiciness.\n\nThis wine is focused and intense. After opening up for a bit, it has completely won me over. Extraordinary. 97-RA. Pairing: I feel it would be a crime to pair anything with this wine except some clean water and neutral bread. The wine is a complete experience in itself.	91.375

Big Ripping tannins. \n\nOVERALL: Doesn't really deliver amazing flavor or complexity - may transform over time (still quite young) but I have zero experience in such matters. I am annoyed at the sweetness. I usually associate residual sugar/overripeness with new-world wines, so I'm puzzled that Galloni (WA) calles Cavallotto a "traditionally minded estate." I'm intrigued and hope to become more familiar with this region in the future. \n\nAccording to Galloni, anticipated maturity is 2011 to 2021. Decanted 1.5 hours before tasting.

Dirty, overripe, smells of cheap milk-chocolate and public urinals. \nPALATE: This wine is exactly what Robert Parker described: lots of residual sugar balanced by high acid. The acid is incredibly high, in fact, and would make the bitter finish unbearable if it weren't for the ton of sugar. I do not like this wine because of the sugar, the nose, the finish, and the flavor profile, but it is certainly well-balnced, and I can see why people like it for the price.	84

Slight dirtiness. Slight rotten quality. Not a good nose. \nPALATE: Everything that is wrong with Australian Shiraz's. Huge amounts of residual sugar. Way to alcoholic (16%). Acidity is too low, but no amount of acidification can save this wine.\n\nThe 2004 vintage was the wine that hooked me in the first place - I had high hopes for this bottle. I'm shocked at the difference in style from the previous vintage. Shocked that the WS can give this 87. There are some tannins, but the finish is sugary and bitter. Not good. for $20, this is unacceptable. Yellow Tail 07 Cab/Merlot actually showed slightly better than B. M. 05 due to high balaning acidity. This is the last straw, I'm not coming back to Australia for a long, long time.	88.68

Then deep cassis, black raspberry, a good amount of manure and funk - reminds me of the Arnoux Bourgogne. 2nd and 3rd tier aromas of smoke and liquorice. Like opals on black satin. \nPALATE: Dry, big, good acidity, pretty good midpalate aromatics, more black raspberry on the palate. Spicy finish. Medium tannins - better than the Puy Bardens but not as strong as I recall by far. A distinct tone of tart cranberries on the finish. My guess: 10 years. For $23, a PASS (on QPR).\n\nPairings:\n\n-1: Beemster - the wine doesn't help the Beemster, and the Beemster completely kills the wine in flavor and texture.. \n0: pizza: the spiciness is somewhat enhanced by the wine, and the wine isn't completely killed. \n0: Manchego: the cheese is enhanced by the wine, but the wine is somewhat killed\n0: Petite Basque: Again, the cheese flavors are unlocked, and become transparent and complex, but the wine is killed. \n+1: Ossau-Iraty: Though the wine is killed, the cheese takes on a fantastically beautiful and intense complexity. Very unexpected.\n\n+1: not a wine pairing: orange-flavored cranberries (TJ's) and Beemster. Mmmmmmmmmmm.	88

Later, the dominant tone that emerged was a sort of bad-olive/rubbery scent, reminiscent of the Cousino Macul the next morning, when the wine had clearly turned.\nPALATE: Dry, watery texture with good tannins. Very little fruit. More of the bad olive/rubber flavor, similar to salvadorean tamales, but sans meat. I don't enjoy this flavor profile. \nCONCLUSION: I'm inclined to say the bottle was flawed - there was very little fruit, and the flavors were just not pleasant.

Not super interesting on the nose, but pleasant and fruity. \nPALATE: Rather dry, for a white. Medium bodied. Decent acidity, but the sweet-acid balance is a little on the sweet side, mostly due to the OVERPOWERING HONEY!!! Cheap, everyday honey for days and days on the finish. A hint of mango-pineapple on the aromatics. Very little bitterness. \nCONCLUSION: A good wine if you like honey. Not complex, but definitely drinkable. At $13.50 maybe not the best QPR I've seen. The honey quality is too much implied sweetness for me. PASS. \n\n13% Alc.	84

Deep with heavy cassis and hints of dark chocolate. Some sour cherry on the back end. \n\nPALATE: Medium bodied, deep in midpalate aromatics - flashes of orange/spice that recalled the Margaux's from the Bdx tasting. Tones of earth - not manure, but every so slightly in that direction. Fairly good structure - decent tannins, but nothing special. Excellent balance. Good acidity, great fruit.

Heavy on the chocolates with raisins. Really reminded me of the Valderiz, but not so on-point, not so focused, not as good an array of aromas. Solid nose, though. \n\nPALATE: Dry. Light to medium body, Excellent acidity balance. Not a very concentrated wine, but good, meaty flavors on the midpalate. A little milk chocolate. A hint of well-integrated bitterness.

Quite strong bitterness. Some fruit/bitter aromas on the midpalate. Finish: bitter, like hops. Not a great finish. Body, similar to the Pouilly-fuisse (chard).

I was apprehensive and a little scared. Tonight I popped it.\n\nThis is, quite simply, the best beer I've ever tasted. It was not what I expected, it achieved things I would never think possible from a beer, and although it has a syrupy sweetness I have always detested, it won me over completely.\n\nNOSE: This is when I knew it was going to be good, or at least interesting. Layers of caramel, wood, smoke, malt ovaltine, coffee, and the interior of a Pan de Coco (a Filipino bread). Also some dried oranges, apple cider. You can dive into this nose and never come out of the bright, intense kaleidoscope of flavors. Don't get me wrong - this is nothing like a good wine. It is not subtle. The non-fruit flavors are more pronounced. But there is fruit, and it is WILD.\n\nPALATE: SWEEEET. We're talking almost desert wine levels. Smoky caramel, spicy orange (even some acidity, unusual for a beer). Strong hops finish that isn't naked like Stone Ruination, but intermingled with layers of fruit and caramel. Holy $#!T this is good! A little lemon on the finish. figs, dates, creme brulee. Explosive and creamy on the midpalate. The hops are more like the liquor bitterness in a nice creme brulee or maybe a tiramu - no, more like Creme Brulee with lots of Brulee and less Creme.\n\nPILLOW: One of the things I like to do when tasting beer is swish GV-style and observe the "pillow" that fluffs up in the mouth. I've had some good pillows - Arrogant Bastard stands out in particular. This left them all behind. I didn't feel like a big pillow appeared in my mouth - I felt like I physically landed in a HUGE pillow. You could jump off the Empire State Building and land safely in this pillow.\n\nThe finish lasts forever. The hops stay, the caramel stays, the orange and spice stays. At least 2 minutes on the finish.\n\nThis is indulgence. This is someone giving you a massage. This is off the charts. If I found a 400-year-old Sauternes that was a little over done, not the finest Sauternes, but one made by a slightly crazed vintner - this is what I might expect.\n\nI'm no fan of dessert wines, but this rocked my world. It blew the 2001 Filhot and the 2005 Tablas Creek Vin de Paille out of the water. A dessert beer!\n\nI recommend having it as dessert. Split it with two other friends - it's too sweet to finish on your own. Serve chilled - the nose will still be there. Too warm and the alcohol shines through, ripping it apart.\n\nWarning: At 20% ABV and 120 IBU's (International Bitter Units) this is not for everyone. For calibration purposes, I am no fan of hard liquor, I like tannic, dry red wines, and I am a major Hop Head. I am stunned by this beer.\n\n20% ABV\n120 IBU's\n$10/12 oz.\nAccording to the bottle: Ages for a decade or so.	92.6

Dark cherries, a little barnyard, a little dirt. Seems pretty closed down. \nPALATE: Big on the dark, sour cherries. A little dirt and black raspberry on the midpalate. Strong tannins on the finish. Lacking in "deliciousness."\nASPECT: Opaque, black. slightly violet at rim.\n\n~20 minutes later:\nA little cab franc, a little greenness that is pissing me off. But really good 3D cherry on the midpalate, with dirt.\n\n~30 minutes later:\nWith food. Really became unpleasant like the Bourgeil Chanteleuserie cab franc. Bitter, green, tannic. No fruit. Bitter aftertaste. I think something killed this. Food: Asiago roast beef sandwich, fr. onion soup (panera). A little horseradish sauce on the sandwich. The wine isn't drinkable - fruitless and green, without the coffee tone of the Chanteleuserie. \n\nNext morning (vacuumed):\nMore sour cherries, but with definite barnyard. fruit opening up on the palate more. still strong tannins. A slight creamy/vanilla/pastry tone emerged. A little spice, a little coffee. \n\n~30 minutes: The dark cherry is making itself more known. Very tannic. still a hint of barnyard. dark cherry has some zingy acidity. A little acidity on the finish. Like lindt 89% dark.\n\n~24 hrs:\nOpened up nicely - some more black cherries, still little barnyard. A little more delicious but still slightly green. Vicious tannins - bad texture still. The finish has improved. Fruit lingers for ~30 seconds before fading into just tannins. Some of the slightly creamy, yogurt aspect. Sweetens quite a bit. \n\nCONCLUSION: A difficult wine. Lean on the fruit. Good strong tannins, but I don't like the tannins' texture for some reason. Not delicious. PASS. $15	81

Dark fruits, rich and deep aromas. A little tea, a little rose petals, a little wood/forest floor, but mostly interesting and intense fruit. \nPALATE: Light body, but not as light or candylike as the Roux Pere et Fils Beaujolais-Village. This was much more real. Good fruit on the midpalate. Slightly sweet, but with very gripping acidity that paired excellently with the Indian food. Much more acidic than Roux Pere. Very smooth - low alcohol? (would make sense: carbonic maceration). The finish was the only weak part, with a little unpleasant bitterness mixed with long, lingering acidity. Not tannic.

After an exceptional bouquet, quite distinct from Barrel Monkeys Shiraz and the Marquis Philips Shiraz, the light, acidic body with only moderate fruit concentration did not quite satisfy. The finish, though, lasted almost half a minute, with strong, fruity tannins.\n$15/half\n\nFull:\nThe bouquet was full and lush. Instead of the Marquis Philips' Plum and ripe pear notes, or the B.M.'s dark blackberries and smoke, this syrah smelled of bright warm hillsides, sun-drenched raspberries, gentle wood tones, and freshly baked bread. Not intense or powerful, the aromas were nevertheless mesmerizing, enchanting, and seductive. We tasted from two types of glasses - Reidel's 'Bordeaux' tumbler, and a Ravenscroft Vintner's Amplifier. While the Ravenscroft displayed a more concentrated aroma, each type of glass developed a distinct nose, both delicious. We took the first taste 20 minutes after decanting, and for the next hour or two, the bouquet continued to change, each inhalation releasing subtly different flavors.\n\nIf the bouquet was revelatory and beautiful, the taste and mouthfeel were not quite satisfying. It tasted good on the palate - all the elements of a Shiraz came through nicely, but it lacked texture, chewiness, and extract. The clear note of acidity (not present in Barrel Monkeys, present in Marquis Philips, but squashed by the sweetness) was not unpleasant, though wanted for more supporting fruit concentration. After such an attractive and lush nose, the mouthfeel and taste seemed a poor confirmation. The finish, however, was long, nicely tannic, and fruit-filled.\n\nRP on the Saint-Joseph AOC:\n"The northern Rhône's most underrated appellation for red and white wine. The reds and whites are juicy and best drunk young, preferably within 10 years of the vintage. No northern appellation has made as much qualitative progress as St.-Joseph. Moreover, these wines are fairly priced." - WBG 6th Ed. 698\n\nAromatic Profile:\n"The red wines are the lightest, fruitiest, and mst feminine of the northern Rhône... Syrah can be at its fruitiest, lightest, and most charming in this appellation. A good St.-Joseph red should display a Burgundy-like black cherry, raspberry, and occasionally cassis-scented nose with medium body, light tannin, and zingy acidity. These are the Rhône's Valley's lightest reds and are best drunk in their first 5-6 years of life." - WBG 6th Ed. 705\n\nTextural Profile:\n"Good fruit presented in a medium-bodied, zesty format is the hallmark of a fine St.-Joseph red. They should not possess tannin for support, but rather crisp acidity"- WBG 6th Ed. 705 \n\nLouis Chèze:\n"This is a northern Rhône estate to watch carefully.

Opened while cooking Thanksgiving dinner. On the nose, it never developed the strong aromatics I remembered. It seemed to take on onion and pie characteristics at different times, depending on what it was close to. In fact, the nose seemed "tired" the entire time. Pretty disappointing.

The simplicity of this wine becomes boring after a glass or two, perhaps sooner if one is already acquainted with the flavor profile, and I eventually found the sweetness to be cloying.

In the mouth this wine revealed a light body, with subdued acidity and slightly sweet fruit on the midpalate (by which I mean the part of the palate where the sense of smell is most in play. In time, the point right before swallowing, if you were to swallow). The texture was soft and watery, with a little milkiness. The finish revealed lots of soft tannins with some bitterness. A rather weak, subdued wine. Drinks easily.\n$13\n\nTasting Notes:\n\nBenefited noticeably from aeration. After two hours or so, it was a bit better than 20 minutes after opening. However the aroma was always slightly weak and "closed." Tasted in close to ideal conditions, out of the Reidel bordeaux, and the Ravenscroft amplifier.\n\nThis 70:30 Cab/Shiraz blend possessed a pleasant, if rather tenuous, nose of light cherries and a hint of spiced orange. Due to the weakness of the aroma it was a bit difficult to detect subtleties under the relative strength of the alcohol fumes, and my nose was left somewhat singed by the experience. At times, the smell was a bit fake and artificial. At one point, there was a whiff of something warm and wholesome, akin to the smell of pie still baking. In the mouth this wine revealed a light body, with subdued acidity and slightly sweet fruit on the midpalate. Perhaps it was the tannins that evoked a soft, watery-milk texture, because it certainly wasn't high extract or concentration of fruit or alcohol (13%). The finish revealed lots of smooth tannins with some bitterness. A weak, wimpy wine that requires too much effort to detect its only slight complexity. Drinks easily and tastes quite sweet after a while, though not nearly to the extent of the Beaujolais-Villages.	84

Gross. $12 (community)\n\nFull:\n\nThis Cab/Shiraz/Merlot/Tempranillo (49.3/28/17.7/5) has a nice nose of cherries with some raspberry character. There is also a shy but at times surprising second character of strong mineral scents, perhaps best described as wet metal. Medium-bodied, with a slightly syrupy texture, there is good fruit on the midpalate and a long finish with good, though not gripping tannins. Unfortunately the syrupy sweetness pervades the entire drinking experience, persisting almost as long as the tannins. The acidity is very low - which normally I wouldn't mind, but here it could have offset the sugar, and made the wine drinkable if not great. A disappointment from Vine St. Imports, the importer of both Barrel Monkeys and Small Gully The Formula.\n\n"A delicious blend boasting a deep ruby/purple-tinged color as well as plenty of berry fruit intermixed with notions of smoke, herbs, and spice box. Fine texture, abundant fruit on the palate, and a plump finish suggest this amazing value should be drunk over the next 1-2 years." RP-88	87

On the palate, it was sweet like the others, almost medium-bodied (due to high glycerin concentration, perhaps?) with ripe melon and yeast on the midpalate.

The acidity was low, but the sweetness was countered by a notable bitterness that first makes itself felt in the midpalate then lingers through the finish. A slight alcoholic bite on the back of the throat gives the impression of "spiciness." I'm not a big fan of the bitterness, but I can see how many would consider this a "well-balanced" wine.

Tasted at the Corkscrew.\n\n-- Full: \nThere is considerable fruit on the nose - green grapes (a wine that smells like grapes? incroyable!) with strong lemon and a hint of a diametrically opposite smell - perhaps overripe canteloupe. Sweet with balancing acidity, the body was unremarkable on the midpalate. In the finish, where tannins would take hold in a red wine, the flavor suddenly vanishes, leaving a tasteless but faintly sweet and viscous feeling, slightly warmed by alcohol. I know glycerol is viscous, and I've read that it imparts a slight sweetness to wine, so I'm going to guess that this finish is mostly glycerol.	88

The concentration and extract fill the mouth, though the texture is watery. The acidity is noticably higher than Les Hautes Pontet-Canet, there is noticeable fruit on the midpalate, but the wine is really dominated by incredible, full, round, gripping tannins. The tannins will probably age this wine well, though it is too acidic and thin-textured for my tastes. The bouquet is very interesting, and I do not at all feel I completely understood its nuances. (RP 90) $47.\n\nFull:\nA clear, delicious note of fruit gave way to an aromatically complex bouquet, suggesting dark cherries, mellow cherries, and mereschino cherry tones, along with earth/wood/spice notions. Again this is a rough description, possibly confounded by ambient aromas, but this bouquet would probably be interesting to observe in-vitro-vinum. The bouquet seemed to me beautiful - not sickeningly sweet like the beaujolais' single scent. In the mouth this wine somewhat failed to satisfy. It was not viscous, though there was great concentration of flavour, and I suppose in one sense, the wine's flavor was "mouthfilling." It was noticeably more acidic than Le Hautes Pontet-Canet, but with absolutely incredible, full, round, gripping tannins. There is fruit on the mid-palate, possibly a lot of fruit, though it was hard to tell as I was (excitedly!) distracted by the tannins. The finish was long, and dominated by tannins. I can see how this might be an excellent wine when the tannins mellow and uncover more fruit, though to my taste it is a bit too acidic and not full-bodied enough.	91.5706371191136

NOSE: Very reticent, even after warming in hands. Only the faintest hint of fruit. No lemon characteristic. Dull yeast. Maybe, just maybe, there was a hint of canteloupe rind. PALATE: Watery mouthfeel, thin flavor - poor concentration, hollow on the midpalate, some bitterness, acidity was not balanced by fruit or residual sugar - there was very little residual sugar, so it was fairly dry- much drier than the 06 Riesling Tradition. I didn't see the "minerality" but it could have been there. $24. Pass	87
596174	314357	Red	2006	Mollydooker Shiraz The Boxer	Australia, South Australia	Mollydooker	Shiraz	Syrah	Australia	South Australia	1/23/2008	False	65	This wine has become so popular that its price has inflated by 70% over Sarah and Sparky's intended price. Knowing about their glycerol-boosting methods, I expected a super-rich, overly-sweet wine that bore no resemblance to Shiraz. It turns out there was more to the wine than I expected. NOSE: Lots of alcohol interference, at times appeared more muted than the other's. Noteable and pleasing Shiraz note framed by rich, real fruit. A delicious if not complex nose. PALATE: As expected, glycerol sweetness prevailed. It struck me as less sweet than the Angels Share, and its quality of sweetness was different ("bluer"?). I think I am starting to be able to differentiate glycerine sweetness from sugar sweetness. A long, extracted wine, with a spicy bite, and bigger tannins than any of the others. To my palate, significantly better than the '06 Maitre D'. I appreciate that Sarah and Sparky Marquis have developed a truly unique, recognizable style of wines. In a blind tasting, I might have guessed Redbank, probably would have mistaken Winner's Tank and Angels Share for each other, but I'm sure I would have recognized the Mollydooker. Not drinkable for my palate. 94-JM, $34	88.8519855595668

Highly rated by Robert Parker in past vintages, a quick sniff as we were decanting revealed an earthy, delicious shiraz aroma. NOSE: Great shiraz with buttery blueberry muffins. The earthiness I smelled during decanting devolved into a faint "barnyard" smell. I use that term because "poop" is somewhat indelicate. I didn't appreciate this particular scent. In this day and age, people should be able to make clean wines, especially for 34 bones! PALATE: Sugar syrup. I was so disappointed I couldn't concentrate on the rest of the palate. It may have been slightly spicy. Certainly the tannins were very slight. At least it was sugary sweet instead of glycerine fake-sweet like the Mollydooker. I don't know how Jay Miller can give this a 93. Even if it tastes delicious, the combination of the alcohol and sugar, with low acidity and tannins, makes it cloying, densely undrinkable. Seriously: 3/4 of a glass of this wine and you feel your gorge rise! $34. JM-93.	89.2407407407407

PALATE: Also sweet, but balanced by slightly higher acidity than the Winner's Tank. Don't recall the finish. This was the first wine to be finished at the tasting - possibly the most drinkable of the four. The '05 version earned 75-JM. Too sweet for me. $9.	70

Several delicious tones I could not name. PALATE: slightly sweet, more than BM. Low acidity. Attacks the palate with extracted fruit. Aromatic midpalate. Long finish that unbalances, first faintly bitter, then fading into a sour aftertaste. Weak tannins. several largish particles of black fruit residue made it clear that this wine is unfiltered!

On the palate the viscosity is low, but nevertheless the feel is weighty, concentrated, and mouth-filling. Low acidity. Faint background sweetness. Fruit blooms on the midpalate, leading into a strong, persistent finish of sweet tannins. While I have had wines with more gripping tannins, and wines with more viscous bodies, no wine so far has matched up to this as a complete, seamless beauty.

Not a flavor profile that really resonates with me. Tannins are too weak for my tastes. A well-made, super-flavorful, undeniably balanced, clean wine. Not aromatically complex.\n\nNOSE: Shiraz ("sulfur") and Cabernet ("chocolate-candied-cherry") tones come through, with black raspberry and a hint of synthetic apple.\n\nPALATE: Only faintly sweet. Just enough acidity that it doesn't grab attention, but frames the fruit well. Tannins are weak. This concentrated, mouth-coating wine attacks the palate with dark, savory, spicy, extracted fruit. The savory-bitter midpalate character carries through to the finish, jousting with the weak tannins long after the fruit has faded. Not viscous in the mouth, but intensely flavorful, weighty.\n\nASPECT: Brilliant, deep purple-red. ~2mm of clear meniscus.

No citrus like the Barmes Buecher. Not delicious or interesting.\n\nPALATE: Sweet. Good, crisp acidity, but still sweet. A nice bit of mild frizzante. The midpalate displays more bitter, overripe canteloupe. The viscosity is low to medium, with a faintly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with bitter, overripe melon, then fades to warmth, but it is not clean like Barmes Buecher, but ends with jousting sour and bitter notes. I now appreciate that the Barmes Buecher Riesling Tradition '06 was an exceptionally fruity, balanced, and clean-finishing wine. 12% Alcohol.\n\nASPECT: Clear, pale, with a faint tinge of yellow-gold.\n\nWITH CURRY: Devolved into sweet, sour, and bitter. Any fruit was masked, though the acidity did cut through the mild curries. Aroma: eventually just bitter. Not appetizing.\n\nCONCLUSION: Too sweet for me. Really nothing going on with this wine. $15	60

PALATE: Served too cold (makes sense - they had just opened it). This was even sweeter and more tannic than the wine I'd just tasted - the 2004, giving me cause to wonder if sweetness and tannins have a cumulative build-up effect. Tannins should build after a certain point, as one's palate runs out of salivary lubricating enzymes (which are denatured by tannins). Back to this wine: Some fruit on the midpalate. Clean finish.

The main scent was of freshly manured dirt, with a little cranberries and strawberries. A little creamy dark chocolate action too (an oxymoron? perhaps not). It didn't do much for me initially. And I can't say it was immediately delicious, but it was interesting, and it drew me back and eventually grew on me. Perhaps we didn't decant early enough. After a while, a brief tone of tight, but pleasant-smelling fruit shone through. Perhaps the grapes were not completely ripe in this vintage. \n\nPALATE: If the nose had hints of milk chocolate, the palate was dark chocolate all day long! It reminded me of 99% Teuscher dark chocolate. If you've never had it, it's dark and bitter yet bizzarely creamy. The wine had a powerful attack of rustic earthy flavors, medium viscosity, explosively flavorful midpalate with good chocolate aromatics. Like satin in the mouth! The finish treated me to a little skit: first Alcohol and Tannins danced a little jig around a small, fading Cranberry. Then the little Cranberry spoke up with a bright, acidic tone. Finally, Tannins and a glorious Dark Chocolate Bitterness took the show home. The tannins gripped my tongue on the first taste, and did not let go until half an hour after the meal. It was really, really good. Stronger, fuller, riper tannins than Barrel Monkeys. The acidity was present but not overt. The tannins were huge. This wine was a heap of fresh manured earth, supported by a stone wall of tannins with acidity as mortar. It really tasted like running into a rock wall. I would have liked more fruit, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. \n\nASPECT: Dark saturated color, slightly purple (dim light). \n\nWith Indian food: I was left with just the manured earth smell and the tannins. Didn't go fantastically, but I'd try it again at a less noisy/aromatic Indian restaurant. $23	88

Very clear, bold nose, even when chilled. \n\nPALATE: Super sweet, viscous, with good balancing acidity. Just enough acidity and low enough bitterness that it wasn't cloying for me, but it was right there on the fence. After a few sips, it was too much. Excellent midpalate aromatics - the midpalate is where this really shines, with honeylike mouthfeel, a sugary bite, explosive, delicious fruit, and only very little bitterness. Good finish: clean, not bitter, dried apricots, long. The first really sweet wine that didn't make me shudder with every sip - contrast with the Malivoire Gewurz (too little acidity, too much bitterness) and the Tablas Creek vin de paille (too low acidity, too sweet). I'm still not a fan of dessert wines, but this is clearly the best I've had so far by a significant margin. 88-RA	88.6220472440945

It hints towards barnyard, but is clearly more in the direction of clean, fresh earth. The nose is interesting, and to me, just barely on the delicious side of the fence. It made my mouth water, but also gave me pause. I like it. From the dregs, a whiff of raisins. When watered down, faint jasmine. \n\nPALATE: Soft, but not satiny, medium-weight, medium-viscosity, a little hot. Flavor-wise, coats and seduces the palate, with midpalate aromatics of black raspberry, blackcurrant, and black liquorice. Dry, but the impression of sweetness grows. Very similar to Barrel Monkeys in overall structure: acidity, quality of fruit, and tannin content. Slightly disjointed, coarse tannins, though subdued, like Barrel Monkeys. However unlike BM, this has an earthy component, and brings a distinct spiciness to the flavor profile. The finish is similar to dark chocolate spiked with a tad of habanero. The fruit is short-lived, primarily inhabiting the midpalate, while the finish is carried by dark chocolate bitterness and almost convincing tannins. \n\nWith FOOD: The nose is slightly manure-like but note quite. Manure-like without the bad stuff? I found it... interesting. On the palate, black raspberry is the main characteristic. The beef ribs totally overpowered the tannins. The growing sweetness was a little much considering the already-sweet teriyaki sauce. For about a glass, it paired well. I was on the fence with each sip, but ever-so-slightly on the appreciative side. However another glass would have pushed me into the cloying region. Like Huitlacoche but more on the "I like it" side.

The aromas are complex, smoky, rich, and deep. PALATE: On the midpalate, this wine reveals a dimension that clearly sets it apart from the other wines in the Bordeaux tasting. Complex, delicious earthy tones, suggesting nuts, woods, forests, hay, cheeses - all appeared in quick succession during midpalate aeration. The mouthfeel is like heavy, luxurious, satin. Still very tannic, which I love. The finish is long. Hints of green tea with matcha. ASPECT: Black.

I'm starting to think that the Corkscrew's selection isn't too bad - very francocentric - but they SUCK at getting good prices. Anyhow... I was told the sancerre was unoaked and minerally, this is what I got: \n\nNOSE: Some fruit but overpowering nuttiness, I want to say oakiness, but I'm really not sure what oak smells like, and they did say it was unoaked... Faint grapefruit. PALATE: Slightly sweet (dry compared to Rieslings) with excellent balancing acidity. More nuttiness on the palate. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Just a little bitterness, nothing too bad. Slight acidity on the finish, but in a good way. The finish was clean. \n\nMy overall impression was: Rich, creamy and nutty. One-dimensional on the nose. I personally don't find it that interesting or delicious, but it was certainly a new experience! Not worth $14 per half bottle for me. I'd have more fun with a tannic madiran.

Coffee + bellpeppers?. The only fruit is a hint of blackberry, Definitely a little manure and dirt. Mostly, though, it's one-dimensional: coffee. \n\nPALATE: good tannic grip, medium bodied, light texture, the coffee flavour attacks the palate. Good tannic grip. The finish is like dark Valrhona with espresso, mixed with veggies like GV's bellpeppers. I like the tannin structure and the strong flavours. While I normally don't like bitterness, the bitterness here is of the coffee/chocolate type, which I dig. The fruit is very subdued, however, and the "coffee-esque" flavor is very unripe. \n\nConclusion: Weird to my palate. Not that ripe or delicious. Not nearly as complex or interesting as the Arnoux Bourgogne I had earlier. As a food wine, very nice - good structure. However when I paired it with a Manchego (not very good Manchego) an it didn't really go. Didn't do anything bad, but didn't do anything good, either.\n\nPoint rationale: Interesting intro to Cab Franc taste. missing a "delicious" factor. Also not complex/ did not change in the glass. Wouldn't buy this again.\n\nNOTE: In retrospect, when compared to the Mas de Libian Cotes du Rhone, this might have needed more time to open up. $14. DS-89	90

Definitely some manure, leather sandals on a hot day, forest soil, some smoke, and a new shoes component. There's definitely also a little funkiness which I didn't notice at first, and eventually blew off - maybe Brett? Very interesting, always changing. \n\nPALATE: Light, gentle, and watery on the palate. Very little texture in the mouth. Dry. A little salty/savoury. Good acid. MIDPALATE AROMATICS: More of the leather, earth, mud, and a little Huitlacoche factor - not the same flavor, but the same kind of attractive dirtiness. Not a lot of fruit, but it is there - a nice warm, round, soft supporting pillow of black raspberries, like the nose. Hard not to swallow this one! New flavors and smells each time. FINISH: No tannins, but dry. The finish veers a little too acidic for my taste, but otherwise is good. After the acidity dies, the faint residual aftertaste had a nice, subtle, black raspberry character.\n\nASPECT: Deep red-garnet, not opaque - can see fingers through the glass. \n\nOverall: Intriguing. $19	89.5
